# Job Preparedness Workshop

#### **Proposed Schedule**:
5 weeks, for 1 hour/week. This will be a combination of lecture, panel, and hands-on learning sessions.

#### **Workshop Promise**:
Apprentices should have a very strong resume, cover letter template, portfolio (frontend apprentice specific), and hopefully web portfolio at the end of this curriculum, along with much more knowledge of the web industry job market and applying for jobs in general.

#### **Description**:
Learning development skills is a crucial part of the apprenticeship curriculum, but we also want apprentices to feel prepared and fully equipped to be applying for and entering the web industry at the end of their time at Sparkbox. This workshop will help apprentices learn to highlight their strengths, and how to approach the job market of the web industry.

Over 5 weeks, we cover the following using both lecture and hands on activities in the Full Stack and Frontend Designer Apprenticeships:

##### Full Stack Apprenticeship Class Description:
  * **Part 1**: Introduction and Resumes
  * **Part 2**: How to Really Read a Developer Job Postings and Cover Letters
  * **Part 3**: Interview/Whiteboarding Preparation Panel (this may take place outside regular class times)
      * This will be a panel of Sparkboxers that can answer questions and describe their own experiences with whiteboarding and inteviews.
  * **Part 4**: Salary Negotiation
  * **Part 5**: QA and Open Work Hour
      * An open hour to ask any lingering questions, and continue working on resumes, cover letters, applying for jobs, portfolios, and their personal websites.
